    get-gauche.sh - Ensure Gauche availability

SYNOPSIS

    get-gauche.sh [--system|--home|--current|--prefix PREFIX]
                  [--auto][--version VERSION][--check-only][--force][--list]
                  [--fixed-path][--sudo]

DESCRIPTION

    The `get-gauche.sh` script is a convenient way to ensure Gauche installed
    on the running platform.  By default, it checks if the desired version
    of Gauche is already installed, and if not, download the tarball and
    install it.

    It can be also used with distributing Gauche applications.
    In the application's configure or installation script, you can call
    get-gauche.sh.

    If --check-only option is given, the script only checks if Gauche
    has already installed but do not attempt to download and install.

    The installation location can be specified by --prefix, --system,
    --home or --current option.  These options are mutually exclusive.  
    When none of these options is given, --home is assumed.

    If --force options is given, the script directly download and install
    Gauche, regardless of whether Gauche is already installed or not.

    By default, installed Gauche is searched in $PATH as well as the
    specified location.  So, for example, if Gauche is installed under 
    /usr and 'get-gauche.sh --home' is run, and if it finds /usr/bin/gosh
    and the version requirement is satisfied, it won't attempt to install
    Gauche unless --force option is given.  If you want to ensure that
    desired Gauche is always installed under specified location, use
    --fixed-path option.

    If you don't have write permission in the install destination, use
    --sudo option to run installation process via sudo.


OPTIONS

    --auto
        When get-gauche.sh finds Gauche needs to be installed, it proceed
        to download and install without asking the user.  By default,
        the user is asked before download begins.

    --check-only
        detect Gauche and report result, but not to attempt download
        and install.

    --current
        install Gauche under the current directory.
        Equivalent to --prefix `pwd`.

    --fixed-path
        detect Gauche only under prefix (specified by --prefix, --system,
        --home or --current option).  By default, get-gauche.sh also checks
        under directories in PATH.

    --force
        regardless of the result of version check, always download and
        install the specified version of Gauche.

    --home
        install Gauche under the user's home directory.
        Equivalent to --preifx $HOME.

    --list
        show valid Gauche versions for --version option and exit.  No
        other operations are performed.

    --prefix PREFIX
        install Gauche under PREFIX.  The gosh executable is in PREFIX/bin,
        binary libraries are in PREFIX/lib, etc.

    --sudo
        invoke 'make install' via sudo.  Needed if you want to install
        Gauche where you don't have write permissions.  You may be asked
        to type your password by sudo.
    
    --system
        install Gauche under system directory.
        Equivalent to --prefix /usr.

    --version VERSION
        specify the desired version of Gauche.  VERSION can be a version
        string (e.g. `0.9.5'), or either `latest' or `snapshot'.  The word
        `latest' picks the latest release.  The word `snapshot' picks the
        newest snapshot tarball if there's any newer than the latest
        release, or the latest release otherwise.
        By default, `latest' is assumed.

EXAMPLES

    1. You want to have the latest release of Gauche.  If the system
    already has it, you can use it.  Otherwise, install under your home
    directory.

       $ get-gauche.sh --home

    2. You distribute a Gauche application, and always want to use Gauche 
    0.9.4 under application-specific directory.  You can run get-gauche.sh
    during the build or installation process of your application as follows:

       $ get-gauche.sh --version 0.9.4 --prefix /app/dir/gauche \
                       --fixed-path --auto

    The --fixed-path option ignores other Gauches installed under PATH
    but only checks /app/dir/gauche.  If there's already 0.9.4 or later
    Gauche under that directory, you'll use it.  Otherwise that version
    is downloaded and installed there.
